The common way to install **subcmd** is using pip:

::

    pip install subcmd

Upgrade is also trivial:

::

    pip install --upgrade subcmd

Also if you prefer, download sources and install manually:

Install from sources
--------------------

Installation from sources is based in python setuptools.

Stable version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Current stable version is |version|

.. raw:: html

   <p><a href="" class="btn">Download stable version</a></p>

Development version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trunk source code is not always stable, please look at our current issues
for help and troubleshooting.

.. raw:: html

   <p><a href="" class="btn">Download trunk version</a></p>


Installing from sources involves the following steps:

::

    tar xvzmf subcmd-*.tar.gz
    cd subcmd
    python setup install

To upgrade just download another version and proceed like a normal
installation.

For old versions and active development branches please, refer to the
project Github `pages <http://github.com/repejota/subcmd>`_.
